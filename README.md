# Python Data Structure Animations (Ltds)

This project demonstrates the operations and methods for Python data structures—List, Tuple, Dictionary, and Set—using simple animations and examples. The goal is to help users understand how these data structures work in real-world applications by visualizing their functionality through examples.
