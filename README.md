# Python Data Structure Animations (Ltds)

This project demonstrates the basic operations and methods for Python data structures—List, Tuple, Dictionary, and Set—using animations. It provides a visual and interactive way to learn about Python's built-in data types, with real-world examples displayed with simple animations.
